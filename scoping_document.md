# Scoping Document for Data Visualization Project
Note : We miss the problem we are addressing.
## Team organization
The method is that all the work that needs to be done has been set on a Github project Page linked to the repository. <br>
We then work remotely seeing the progression rate of each project section. In case of help needed, they reach out in a Whatsapp group or can open help inquiry throught the issue section of the repository. <br>
Each section is divided in many small tasks. Project Route provides us with more insight about the task such as : Level of priority, Size of task, Estimated time to accomplish and Progress state. <br>
This system allows people to work on several aspect of teh project not only specialising into one. The objective is to have each team member able to carry a adata visaulization on it's own. 

## Project Objective
- Provide NBA fans, analysts valuable data to explore strenghts, weakenesses and trends over time in a visual and engaging way.

## Target Audience
- Primary Audience : NBA Fans
- Sport Journalists
- Analysts

The target audience will be able to get a better insight about players and teams taking part of the NBA Championship and will be given keys to try and bet on the next basket-ball champion. <br>
The following visualization will be helpful as this project is a fact-based study therefore offering alternatives to sport-news channels where comments on player's performance are more instinct-oriented.
## Data Sources
The data was obtaines throught web scraping. The source is [BasketBall Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com)
The data was then cleaned to allow further process. 
The web scrapping has been made in the following file : ``` Project.ipynb ```. Special Thanks to *Zied Bouyahya* for the web-scrapping section.
